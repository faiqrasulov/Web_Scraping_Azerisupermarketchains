"Title: Azeri Supermarket Chains Data Scraping and Analysis

Description:
This repository contains a collection of notebooks for scraping and analyzing product and price information from Azeri supermarket chains. The notebooks included are "Bazarstore_Selenium", "Bravo_Selenium", and "Neptun_Scrape", each focused on scraping data from a specific supermarket chain.

Additionally, there is a notebook named "run_all_price_scripts" that acts as a central script to run all three scraping notebooks consecutively. This notebook simplifies the process of collecting data from all the supermarket chains in one go.

Furthermore, the repository includes a notebook called "open_all_price_notebooks" that allows you to input the market chain name, month, and year. It fetches the data from the corresponding Excel files generated by the scraping notebooks and consolidates the monthly information into a single document. This provides an overview and facilitates further analysis of price fluctuations within a specific month.

These notebooks serve as a valuable resource for obtaining and analyzing product and price data from Azeri supermarket chains, enabling researchers, analysts, and enthusiasts to explore and gain insights into market trends and fluctuations.

Please note that before running the notebooks, you need to specify the output directory for saving the generated Excel files. Within the notebooks, there will be a section where you can define the export directory path at the end. 

Note: The repository may require additional dependencies and setup instructions, which are detailed within the notebooks themselves.
